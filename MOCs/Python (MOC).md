# Python (MOC)

Top-level hub for Python concepts and navigation. Use this page to jump to major MOCs and to discover atomic notes.

## Quick Navigation

**New here?** Start with [[Python - Knowledge Graph]] for a complete overview of how all concepts connect.

## Deep-Dive Concept MOCs

Start with any concept and explore atomic notes at different levels of detail:

### Fundamentals
- [[Python - IO (MOC)]] — Input, output, formatting, interactive games, menus, validation
- [[Python - Variables & Types (MOC)]] — Variables, assignment, types, scope
- [[Python - Lists (MOC)]] — Lists, indexing, slicing, methods
- [[Python - Loops (MOC)]] — For loops, ranges, patterns
- [[Python - Conditionals (MOC)]] — If/else, boolean logic, comparisons
- [[Python - Functions (MOC)]] — Functions, parameters, returns, scope
- [[Python - Strings (MOC)]] — Strings, methods, formatting, slicing

### Real-World Applications
- [[Python - Practical Math (MOC)]] — Calculator, percentages, money, time, geometry
- [[Python - Dicts (MOC)]] — Dictionaries, keys, values, iteration
- [[Python - File IO (MOC)]] — File operations, reading, writing

### Tools & Debugging
- [[Python - Debugging (MOC)]] — Errors, tracebacks, debugging strategies
- [[Python - Modules (MOC)]] — Modules, imports, standard library

## Additional MOCs

- [[Python Fundamentals (MOC)]]
- [[Standard Library (MOC)]]
- [[Data Science with Python (MOC)]]
- [[Web Development (MOC)]]
- [[Best Practices & Patterns (MOC)]]
- [[Testing & Debugging (MOC)]]
- [[Tools & Workflow (MOC)]]

Notes:
- Each concept MOC links to 5+ atomic notes for progressive depth.
- Always search the vault before creating a new note to avoid duplicates.
- Use the naming convention: `Python - <Topic> - <Specific Concept>`.
