# Python - <Topic> - <Specific Concept>

## Concept (in your own words)
One short paragraph explaining the idea and the "why".

## Learning Objectives
- Remember: (facts to recall)
- Understand: (key explanations)
- Apply: (simple tasks to practice)

## Syntax
Short summary of relevant syntax or signature.

## Example Code
```python
# Minimal, runnable example showing the core behavior
def example():
    return [i*i for i in range(5)]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(example())
```

## Exercises by Bloom Level
- Remember: short quiz (name the parts / write syntax from memory)
- Understand: explain in one sentence why you'd use this
- Apply: write 1-2 small code exercises with increasing complexity
- Analyze: compare two approaches and list pros/cons
- Evaluate: decide which approach fits which scenario
- Create: build a small project or combined example

## Use Case / Actionability
When to use this; concrete steps and checklist.

## Common Errors / Things to Remember
