# Python - <Topic> - <Specific Concept>

## Concept (in your own words)
One short paragraph explaining the idea and the "why".

## Learning Objectives
- Remember: (facts to recall)
- Understand: (key explanations)
- Apply: (simple tasks to practice)

## Syntax
Short summary of relevant syntax or signature.

## Example Code
```python
# Minimal, runnable example showing the core behavior
def example():
    return [i*i for i in range(5)]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(example())
```

## Exercises by Bloom Level
- Remember: short quiz (name the parts / write syntax from memory)
- Understand: explain in one sentence why you'd use this
- Apply: write 1-2 small code exercises with increasing complexity
- Analyze: compare two approaches and list pros/cons
- Evaluate: decide which approach fits which scenario
- Create: build a small project or combined example

## Use Case / Actionability
When to use this; concrete steps and checklist.

## Common Errors with Example Code

1) First common mistake → Clear description of why it happens

WRONG
# Example showing the incorrect way
result = something_wrong()

CORRECT
# Example showing the correct way
result = something_correct()

2) Second common mistake → Consequence or error message

WRONG
# Buggy code here
bad_code = approach()

CORRECT
# Fixed version
good_code = approach_correctly()

3) Third common mistake → When and why this matters

WRONG
# Easy-to-miss error
quick_mistake()

CORRECT
# Best practice approach
best_approach()
