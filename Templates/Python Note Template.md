# Title: Python - <Topic> - <Specific Concept>

## Concept
One-paragraph explanation in your own words. Explain the why and the high-level idea.

## Syntax
Short summary of relevant syntax or signature.

## Example Code
```python
# Small runnable example illustrating the concept

def example():
    # replace with a minimal but runnable snippet
    return [i*i for i in range(5)]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(example())
```

## Use Case / Actionability
When to use this, quick checklist, and short actionable steps.

## Common Errors with Example Code

1) First common mistake → Clear description of why it happens

WRONG
# Example showing the incorrect way
result = something_wrong()

CORRECT
# Example showing the correct way
result = something_correct()

2) Second common mistake → Consequence or error message

WRONG
# Buggy code here
bad_code = approach()

CORRECT
# Fixed version
good_code = approach_correctly()

3) Third common mistake → When and why this matters

WRONG
# Easy-to-miss error
quick_mistake()

CORRECT
# Best practice approach
best_approach()
