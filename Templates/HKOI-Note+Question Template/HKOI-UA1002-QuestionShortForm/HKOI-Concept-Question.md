### 📚 Quick Lesson

**Concept:**
A computer needs **input** data. A computer gives **output** data. We use the `input()` function to read data. We use the `print()` function to show data.

**Example:**
We need to read the number $5$. We then print the number $5$. The number $5$ is the input. The number $5$ is also the output.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
# Read the input and store it as a string
data = input()

# Print the data to the output
print(data)
```

####START YOUR WORK HERE####



# Read the single word W from input and Store the word in a variable named 'W'.
W = #TODO

# Print the result
#TODO

# print(f"Debug: Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```
