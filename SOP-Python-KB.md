# SOP: Python Knowledge Base (Obsidian)

This document summarizes the standard operating procedure for building a highly-linked, atomic-note Python knowledge base in Obsidian.

## Phase 1 — Macro Structure (MOCs & Folders)
- Create a top-level hub: `Python (MOC)` and make it the primary entry point.
- Define 5–10 major areas and create a MOC for each (e.g., Fundamentals, Standard Library, Data Science, Web, Patterns).
- Keep folder structure shallow: `/MOCs`, `/Python Notes`, `/Code Snippets`, `/Templates`.
- Use links (MOCs) for navigation instead of deep folders.

## Phase 2 — Atomic Notes (Content)
- Search the vault before creating a note. If a matching note exists, improve it instead of adding a duplicate.
- Naming convention: `Python - <Topic> - <Specific Concept>` (e.g., `Python - Data Structures - Dictionaries`).
- Use the template in `/Templates/Python Note Template.md` for each atomic note.
- Write in your own words (explain the why and the how). Include at least one runnable Python snippet.
- Add "Common Errors" or "Things to Remember" to capture practical insights.
- For large resources (books/courses), create an aggregation note linking out to the atomic notes.

## Phase 3 — Linking & Maintenance
- Every atomic note must link back to its most relevant MOC (bottom-up linking).
- Link to non-existing pages for important future notes (Obsidian will mark them as backlinks to create later).
- Prioritize getting content and links into the vault quickly; polish later.
- Install and enable the Obsidian Git community plugin for regular backups and version control.

## Quick Checklist for New Notes
1. Search vault for existing equivalents. 2. Use the `Python - ...` naming convention. 3. Use the template. 4. Link back to a MOC. 5. Add related concept links (create placeholders for missing notes).

## Next Steps I can do for you
- Scan the vault for existing Python notes and suggest merges to avoid duplication.
- Batch-create atomic notes from a table of contents or a course outline.
- Generate more MOCs and populate them with initial links.
