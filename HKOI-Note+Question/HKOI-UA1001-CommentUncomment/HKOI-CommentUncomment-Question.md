### Task ID: UA1001
### Task Title: Comment and Uncomment

-----

### 📚 Quick Lesson

**Concept:**
A comment in Python starts with `#`. Anything after `#` on a line is ignored by Python. Uncommenting means removing the `#` so the code runs.

Example:
```python
# print("This is a comment!")
print("This will run!")
```
