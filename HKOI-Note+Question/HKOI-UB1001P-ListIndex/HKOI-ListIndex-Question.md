### 🖥️ Main Statement

**Story:**
You are given several lines of input. Your task is to store them in a list and print the $i$-th input (1-based index).

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer $k$, the number of input lines.
- The next $k$ lines each contain a string.
- The last line contains an integer $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq k$).

**Output:**
Print the $i$-th input string (1-based index).

**Sample Tests:**

start_time = time.time()
####START YOUR WORK HERE####

# Step 1: Read k
k = # TODO: read integer

# Step 2: Read k lines into a list


# Step 3: Read i (1-based)
i = # TODO: read integer

# Step 4: Print the i-th input (1-based)
print(# TODO: print the correct element)

####END YOUR WORK HERE####
# Stop the timer and print duration (for debug only)
end_time = time.time()
# print(f"Debug: Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```
