### Task ID: UA1046P
### Task Title: While Loop Count Squares

-----

### 🖥️ Main Statement

**Story:**
Write a program that prints all square numbers (1, 4, 9, ...) that are less than the number entered by the user, using a `while` loop.

**Input:**
The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$).

**Output:**
Print all square numbers less than $n$, each on a new line, in increasing order.

**Constraints:**
- $1 \leq n \leq 1000$

**Sample Tests:**
Input:
```
20
```
Output:
```
1
4
9
16
```

Input:
```
1
```
Output:
```
```

Input:
```
10
```
Output:
```
1
4
9
```

**Starter Code**
Copy the code and edit it if you need.

```python
import time
# Start the timer (for debug only)
start_time = time.time()
####START YOUR WORK HERE####

n = int(input())
# TODO: use a while loop to print square numbers less than n

####END YOUR WORK HERE####
# Stop the timer and print duration (for debug only)
end_time = time.time()
# print(f"Debug: Time taken: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```
