# Python - Functions - Definition Basics

## Concept
Define reusable code with `def`. Call it by name to run the code.

## Example Code
```python
def greet():
    print('Hello!')

greet()
greet()
```

## Exercises by Bloom Level
- Remember: Write a simple function.
- Understand: Why reuse code in functions?
- Apply: Define a function with a single line.
- Analyze: When should code be in a function?
- Create: Build a program with multiple functions.

## Common Errors
- Forgetting to call the function (defining ≠ running).
