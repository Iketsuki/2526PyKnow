# Python - Variables - Assignment Basics

## Concept
A variable is a named container for a value. Use `=` to assign a value to a variable name.

## Example Code
```python
name = 'Alice'
age = 14
height = 5.6

print(name, age, height)
```

## Exercises by Bloom Level
- Remember: Write a simple assignment.
- Understand: What does a variable "hold"?
- Apply: Create 5 variables and use them in a sentence.
- Analyze: What happens if you assign to the same variable twice?
- Create: Build a program that stores and combines multiple variables.

## Common Errors
- Confusing `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison).
