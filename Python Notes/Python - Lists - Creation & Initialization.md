# Python - Lists - Creation & Initialization

## Concept
Lists are ordered, mutable collections created with square brackets `[]`. Items can be of any type and mix of types.

## Example Code
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
mixed = [1, 'two', 3.0, True]
empty = []
```

## Exercises by Bloom Level
- Remember: Create a list of 3 numbers.
- Understand: Why use a list instead of separate variables?
- Apply: Create a list of different types.
- Analyze: How many items does `[]` have?
- Create: Build a program that initializes lists for different data categories.

## Common Errors
- Using parentheses instead of brackets.
