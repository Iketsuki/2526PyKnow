# Python - Variables - Types Basics

## Concept
Python has basic types: `int` (whole numbers), `float` (decimals), `str` (text), `bool` (True/False).

## Example Code
```python
count = 5                  # int
price = 9.99             # float
name = 'Bob'             # str
is_student = True        # bool

print(type(count))       # <class 'int'>
```

## Exercises by Bloom Level
- Remember: List the four basic types.
- Understand: Which type would you use for a person's height?
- Apply: Assign a value of each type.
- Analyze: What happens when you mix types in operations? (e.g., `5 + 'hello'`)
- Create: Build a program that demonstrates each type.

## Common Errors
- Using the wrong type for an operation (e.g., math on strings).
