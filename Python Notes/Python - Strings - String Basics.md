# Python - Strings - String Basics

## Concept
Strings are text, created with single `'` or double `"` quotes. Triple quotes `'''` or `"""` allow multi-line.

## Example Code
```python
name = 'Alice'
message = "Hello, World!"
multiline = '''Line 1
Line 2
Line 3'''
```

- Apply: Use both styles in a program.
- Analyze: When use triple quotes?
- Create: Build a program with complex text.
